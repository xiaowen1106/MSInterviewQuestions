Binary Search Tree Questions:

1.Convert a Binary Search Tree to a Double Linked List, without using extra data structure
	example:  10
		     /  \
		    6    14
		   / \   / \
		  4   8 12  16

	to:
	    4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12-> 14-> 16

	Hint: using inorder_tree_walk of a BST

Linked List Questions:

1. Define a Stack structure. Requirement: time efficiency for push(), pop() and min() are all O(1)
	Hint: use a auxiliary stack to maintain the miminum values




Min Max Questions:

1. Given an array of both positive and negative integers, try to find the maximum sum of all its subarraya. Requirement: O(n) time efficiency
